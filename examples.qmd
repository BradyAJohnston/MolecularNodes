To follow this tutorial, ensure you have first [installed Molecular Nodes properly](installation.qmd), including the optional MDAnalysis python package.

# Animating COVID Spike Protein

Download the trajectory files from the the [CHARMM-GUI website](https://charmm-gui.org/?doc=archive&lib=covid19):

You will want to download the `.xtc` files for the spike protein in membrane.

::: callout-caution
The .xtc file will be large, \~2GB so the download may take a while.

Unzip the files (you may need to unzip the unzipped file) and then inside of Molecular Nodes, in the MD Trajectory tab, select the tpology file (`last_frame_nos.pdb`) and the trajectory file (`trj_nos.xtc`).\
\
Give the molecule a name, and your panel should look like this:

## Frames to Import

In the frame import options, we can choose which frames from the trajectory to import.
Importing every frame (`interval = 1` ) will take long time to load, and balloon-out the save-file size of the `.blend` file.
It's best to work with some subset of the trajectory frames, and interpolate between them with Molecular Nodes.\

::: callout-note
Molecular nodes is still surprisingly performant with thousands of frames loaded, but the `.blend` file takes a long time to save and load due to several GBs worth of data being save and loaded each time.
:::

For this example we are going to import every 10th frame.

## Click 'Import Frames' and Wait

Molecular Nodes is working through a lot of data, so this load step can take a few minutes - be patient.
Once it's all loaded, the structure along with the atomic properties are available for use inside of Geometry Nodes!

## Click space to play the animation.

Ensure to change over to `Cycles` & `rendered view` to view the coloured atoms, but otherwise the animation should be playing if press `space`!

_Just Points_

_Rendered View_
In this scene I additionally added a Sun light.

## Geometry Nodes
Now that the animation is imported into geometry nodes, you can work with the points
as you would otherwise. 

Try applying some noise, or in this example, scaling the points to `0` based on 
the proximity to an empty.
