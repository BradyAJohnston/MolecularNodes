To follow this tutorial, ensure you have first [installed Molecular Nodes properly](installation.qmd), including the optional MDAnalysis python package.

# Animating COVID Spike Protein

Download the trajectory files from the the [CHARMM-GUI website](https://charmm-gui.org/?doc=archive&lib=covid19):

You will want to download the `.xtc` files for the spike protein in membrane.

::: callout-caution
The .xtc file will be large, \~2GB so the download may take a while.

Unzip the files (you may need to unzip the unzipped file) and then inside of Molecular Nodes, in the MD Trajectory tab, select the tpology file (`last_frame_nos.pdb`) and the trajectory file (`trj_nos.xtc`).

Give the molecule a name, and your panel should look like this:

## ![](images/paste-E4006B81.png)Frames to Import

In the frame import options, we can choose which frames from the trajectory to import.
Importing every frame (`interval = 1` ) will take long time to load, and balloon-out the save-file size of the `.blend` file.
It's best to work with some subset of the trajectory frames, and interpolate between them with Molecular Nodes.
\

::: callout-note
Molecular nodes is still surprisingly performant with thousands of frames loaded, but the `.blend` file takes a long time to save and load due to several GBs worth of data being save and loaded each time.
:::

For this example we are going to import every 10th frame.

## Click 'Import Frames' and Wait

Molecular Nodes is working through a lot of data, so this load step can take a few minutes - be patient.
Once it's all loaded, the structure along with the atomic properties are available for use inside of Geometry Nodes!
