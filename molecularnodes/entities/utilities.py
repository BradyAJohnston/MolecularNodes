"""
Python module for converting molecular structures from biotite into Blender objects.

This module provides functions to:
1. Create 3D models from biotite AtomArray objects (`create_object`)
2. Attach molecular information as attributes to Blender objects (`atom_array_to_named_attributes`)

The created Blender objects can be used for visualization and manipulation of molecular
structures within Blender's 3D environment. Properties like atom positions, bonds, and
other molecular attributes are preserved as named attributes that can be used with
Geometry Nodes and other Blender features.

    Create a 3D model of the molecule, with one vertex for each atom.

    This function converts a biotite AtomArray into a Blender object with vertices
    representing atoms and edges representing bonds. All atomic properties from the
    AtomArray are stored as named attributes on the Blender mesh, making them
    accessible for use with Geometry Nodes and other Blender features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : AtomArray
        The molecular structure to convert into a Blender object.
    name : str, optional
        Name of the created Blender object. Default is "NewObject".
    centre : str or None, optional
        If provided, centers the object according to the specified criteria.
        Default is None (no centering).
    world_scale : float, optional
        Scale factor to apply to atomic coordinates when creating the model.
        Default is 0.01, which converts Ångströms to a reasonable size in Blender.
    collection : bpy.types.Collection or None, optional
        The Blender collection to add the new object to. If None, the object
        is added to the active collection. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    bpy.types.Object
        The created 3D model, as an object in the 3D scene.
        The object contains vertices for atoms and edges for bonds,
        with all molecular properties stored as named attributes.

    Store all annotations from an AtomArray as named attributes on Blender vertex data.

    This function iterates through the annotations (properties) of a biotite AtomArray
    and stores them as named attributes on a Blender mesh object. These attributes can
    then be accessed and manipulated using Blender's Geometry Nodes system or through Python.

    Only numeric and boolean attributes are stored, as Blender's Geometry Nodes doesn't
    currently support string attributes. String attributes from the AtomArray should have
    been converted to numeric representations during the import process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : AtomArray
        The biotite AtomArray containing molecular data and annotations to be stored.
    obj : bpy.types.Object
        The Blender object (typically a mesh) on which to store the attributes.
    world_scale : float, optional
        Scale factor to apply to size-related values like van der Waals radii.
        Default is 0.01 to convert from Ångströms to Blender units.

    Notes
    -----
    - Coordinate data ('coord') is skipped as it's already stored as vertex positions.
    - 'hetero' flag is also skipped from the annotations.
    - Any string attributes that were converted to integer codes will have the '_int'
      suffix removed when stored on the mesh.
