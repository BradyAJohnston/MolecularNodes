    description: >-
      Get information for the selected edge, evaluated on the point domain. The "Edge Index" selects the edge from all
      possible connected edges. Edges are unfortunately stored somewhat randomly. The resulting information is between
      the evaluating point and the point that the edge is between. Point Index returns -1 if not connected. In the video
      example, cones are instanced on each point where the Edge Index returns a valid connection. The Edge Vector can be
      used to align the instanced cone along that edge. The length of the edge can be used to scale the cone to the
      other point. As the "Edge Index" is changed, the selected edge changes. When "Edge Index" == 3, only the atoms
      with 4 connections are selected, which in this model (1BNA) are just the phosphates.

    name: Point Edge Angle
    description: >-
      Calculate the angle between two edges, selected with the edge indices. For molecule bonds, combinations of [(0,
      1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] will select all possible bond angles. In the video example, two edges
      are selected with their "Edge Index" values. Those atoms which aren't valid return false and do not get instanced.
      The two edge vectors are used to calculate the perpendicular vector through cross product, around which the
      rotation for the cone is rotated. This demonstrates the ability to calculate the edge angle between the two
      selected edges.

    name: Points of Edge
    description: >-
      Finds the conntected point for the selected "Edge Index", and returns each point index for all of the points
      connected to that point. If the connection doesn't exist, or the connection is back to the original point, -1 is
      returned. In the video example, a new point is selected based on the "Edge Index". At that point, all of the
      connecting points are exposed as indices `0, 1, 2, 3`. If that index is not a valid point or connection, or the
      point is the same as the original point that is being evaluated, then -1 is returned. This is one of the more
      complicated topology nodes, but allows indexing of the atoms that are bonded to a bonded atom. This helps with
      doing calculations for planar molecules.

      Calculate the distance and the vector between the evaluating point and the point selected via the Index. In the
      example video, each point is calculating a vector and a distance between itself and the indexed point. When the
      Point Mask node is used, this index is then on a per-group basis, so each point in the group points to just the
      group's corresponding point.
