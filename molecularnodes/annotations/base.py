    Base class for an Annotation

    Any Entity that needs annotations support can derive from this base class
    for Entity specific annotations. The derived entity annotation  will have
    to implement '__init_subclass__' to register with the Entity's annotation
    manager and '__init__' to pass the entity to annotations.

    Entity annotations will have to implement the 'draw' method that specifies
    how to display the annotations. An optional 'defaults' method can be provided
    to set default values to the annotation.
