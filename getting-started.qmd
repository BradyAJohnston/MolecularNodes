This is an introduction to some of the basic functionality of Molecular Nodes to import and colour a protein by amino acid name.
Molecular Nodes and Geometry Nodes in general has a lot more advanced functionality, but this can get quite complex quite quickly.
Please see the additional tutorials for how to use some of that functionality.
I also recommend finding more general Geometry Nodes tutorials for Blender, as all of that knowledge will help you work with Molecular Nodes inside of Blender and producing cool protein visualisations!

Once you start getting the hang of it, I find the best way to learn is just to play around, plugging different nodes into different sockets to see what might happen - the result might not be what you were looking for but something that you really like!

## YouTube Tutorials

I have also made a series of YouTube tutorials walking through some of the functionality of Molecular Nodes.

# Downloading from the PDB

To download a model from the PDB, all you need is the 4-character PDB ID.

### Navigating to Molecular Nodes panel

Navigate to the Molecular Nodes panel under the Scene Properties tab.

The Molecular Nodes panel should now be visible in the bottom right of the screen, you may need to scroll down the Scene Properties tab.
If the boxes are grayed our and a warning is shown saying there is a missing package, complete the [installation steps](installation.qmd) to ensure Atomium is installed and available.

### Downloading the PDB ID

Input the 4-character code for the structure you wish to download and press the 'Download' button to download and import the structure into blender.
If the structure contains information on a biological assembly, tick the 'Build Biological Assembly' when importing to additionally build the assembly on import.

### Viewing the Structure

There should now be atoms visibly in the viewport, and a new collection in the collections tab that contains the structure and the properties for the imported protein.

By default, the atoms are only visible in the Cycles render engine.
Switch over to rendered view and change to Cycles to view the atoms of your structure.

# Geometry Nodes

Switch over to the Geometry Nodes tab and change the viewport to rendered view, to view the atomic structure again.

You can now interact with and manipulate the atoms in the structure using the nodes inside of geometry nodes.

Try scaling the radius of the atoms by adjust the `Scale Radii` value on the `MOL_atomic_properties` node, or changing the base colours of the different elements.

## Atomic Properties

A limitation of Molecular Nodes currently is the inability to have text attributes.
To get around this, Molecular Nodes translates the different properties into numerical versions, and provides nodes to interact with the numeric versions of the data.

### Amino Acid Names

For example, the different amino-acid names have been assigned values from 1-20 based on alphabetical order.
The properties is available from the `MOL_atomic_properties` nodes under the `AA_name` property.
The property is a green diamond, indicating that it is an *integer field* and compatible with other numeric field sockets.

As an example, we can generate a random colour based on the *numerical representation* of the amino acid name, and colour out atoms based on that.

Create a `Random Value` node by pressing `Shift + A` inside of the Geometry Nodes window and selecting *Utilities* -\> *Random Value*, and placing the node.
Change the random type from `Float` to `Vector`.
Plug the output of the `AA_name` into the `ID` of the `Random Value` node and plug the output into the different coloured sockets for the different elements in the `MOL_style_colour` node, as shown below.

We are creating a random numerical vector, with generated from the amino acid name.
While we have created a *numeric vector* and not a *colour vector,* Blender treats an `XYZ` vector the same as an `RGB` vector and *vice-versa*, so you can use them interchangeably.

The different atoms should now be coloured based on their amino-acid name.
