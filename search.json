Inside of Blender they are X Y and Z. X and Y form the flat grid that you see in the viewport, being coloured TODO red and green respectively, while Z is the blue vertical axis.

You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\n\nThe starting style MOL_style_atoms_cycles is only visible via inside of the Cycles render engine. You can add other styles manipulate the data through other nodes, by adding them with Shift + A and navigating to the MolecularNodes panel at the bottom. There are several categories of nodes for different animations and styles. You can add the Ribbon Protein node, which will create a ribbon representation based on the alpha carbons in the structure.

Equal to the Z parameter in the periodic table (or proton composition of a nucleus).\n\n\n\nSimilar to the node above, lays out the most common biological atomic components with name and coding for selection.\n\n\n\nBoth Distance and Slice Nodes work the same way, the inputs are foregin objects, and the outputs are selections for the geometry of the molecule imported with Molecular Nodes (aka the information for a specific geometry nodes modifier). In Blender, objects used for constraints and animations are often Empties, objects with no visual instance used to influence other objects’ properties.\nDistance returns the value of the distance between your molecule and the selected object, as well as what’s inside and outside the Scale Cutoff as an atom selection.\nSlice looks at the position of another object and outputs selections for the molecule based on XYZ axis.\n\n\n\nUses the res_id attribute to generate a selection based on the enumeration ID of residues in the molecuel.\nComposed of the two possibilities, Res Single and Res Range, referencing the selection of a single residue or sevral contiguous at once.\n\n\n\nUses the res_name attribute to generate selection for either amino acids or nucleic acids.\n\n\n\nLets you add the whole molecule selection to the input one (or generates it if no input).\n\n\n\nLets you select specific types of atoms in the backbone and whole backbone or sidechains.\n\n\n\n\nTo replicate trajectories, all the states/frames are loaded in as an object in a collection, and these nodes allow for frame interpolation.\nFor most of the nodes of this category, it is important to place the origin of the geometry in the right place.\nPositions are actualised temporally based on random values or noise, and the Animate 0..1 value drives the progress of the animation, it can be either fed animation value, or it can be keyframed by Blender internal tools.\nThe Wiggle scales with the b_factor attribute, and the Curve redistributes input atoms along the instanced profile curve of choice (will be done relative to coordinates, this is why geometry origin is especially important to get right).\n\n\n\nWhen the PDB file imported contains information about Biological Assemblies (i.e. superstructure polymer for a protein, for example virus capsid), these information can be called upon to realize the assemblies and center them.\n\n\n\nWhen a DNA object is imported, a curve will follow the general path of helix and bases will be instanced in the prim_DNA collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurve : input curve where the helix is generated.\nBases : dNTPs in a collection that are instaced on the helix.\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Instances : Rotated instances that can be realized on a curve with Instance on Points (pick instance).\nHelix Curve : The guiding curve for nucleic bases (can be treated as a “Points” distribution”.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPicks base instances from the prim_DNA colection generated on import or on node instancing and colors them.\n\n\n\nWorks essentially the same as for Styling nodes described above, just for bases instead of residues.\n\n\n\n\nNodes used inside other nodes of this addon to facilitate geometry manipulation."
