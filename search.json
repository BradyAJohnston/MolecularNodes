The outputs of these are are a boolean True / False for each atom. The logical test being performed depends on the node. To recreate the selection above, we can use the Select Chain and Select Res Name nodes.\n\n\n\nReplicating the same selection in Molecular Nodes\n\n\nThis might initially seem quite verbose. The good thing however is that these selections can always be updated and tweaked. They can even be created procedurally based on the values of other selections or animations.\nIn the example video below we are using the selection to apply the Atoms style. We can change the residues and chains that are selected by ticking and unticking the boxes. Each of these selections also take a field input, so they can use the output of other selection nodes. The selections from the two nodes are being combined with the Boolean Math node set to And. Other boolean math operations are also available.\nVideo",

    "text": "Geometry Nodes Editor\nThis is where we edit the node graph for Molecular Nodes. The node graph is a geometry processing program you create, that is read and executed by Blender from left to right. Each node performs an action on the geometry that is passed into it, and the result of that action is passed out to the right. Think of it as creating a set of rules for the computer to follow. You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\nThe data flows like a river, along the green noodles of the node graph. There must be only 1 final output. If you are using the molecular data, then there must also be a single input.\n\n\n\nExample node tree, demonstrating the flow of information through the nodes.\n\n\nThe data flows from left to right, like water through a river.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n  B --&gt; D(Style)\n  D --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Geometry Nodes workspace.\n\n\nThe starting style MOL_style_atoms_cycles is only visible via inside of the Cycles render engine. You can add other styles manipulate the data through other nodes, by adding them with Shift + A and navigating to the MolecularNodes panel at the bottom. There are several categories of nodes for different animations and styles. You can add the Ribbon Protein node, which will create a ribbon representation based on the alpha carbons in the structure. If there is not colour in the structure, ensure that the node has a material MOL_atomic_material at the bottom of the node.\n\nThe data flows through the node graph from left to right. There should always be one input, which is the atomic data that is stored in the 3D mesh of the atoms and bonds. There should also be only one output, which is the final geometry that has been created throughout the node graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n\n  B --&gt; D(Style 1)\n  B --&gt; E(Style 2)\n  B --&gt; S(Style 3)\n\n  sS[Selection] --&gt; S\n\n  E --&gt; F[Join\\nGeometry]\n  D --&gt; F\n  S --&gt; F\n\n  F --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the diagram, the flow of the data can split across multiple different branches of the tree, with the result of each parallel computation being combined before being exported.\nEach of these different branches can be a different style, in this example shown two different styles are applied, and the third style has a custom selection. All of the styles are the result of the same data manipulation.\nThe node graph in between can be as complex as you want to make it, as long as there is a continuous connection to the output of the geometry, it should produce a result.\n\n\n\nAn example of a more complex node graph, with multiple branches that diverge and come back together.\n\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\nThe data flows through the node tree from left to right, along the bright green lines. The atomic data comes in, goes through layers of manipulation, a style is applied, and the created geometry is then outputted from the node tree.\n\nEditing the Styles\nTo change how each style looks, you can edit the default values of the nodes. By changing the values, you change the numbers that are used in the creation of the 3D models. The style will only change if it is being output through the node tree. You can click and drag to change the values smoothly. You can hold Shift while dragging the values to change them more accurately.\n\n\nVideo\nTweaking the default values of the styles.",

    "text": "Hook & Pin\nSometimes we don’t want points to be simulated, and instead we want to manually specify their positions. This is done via the Hook and Pin inputs. Pin will stop the point from simulating at all and ensure that the points is always exactly at the Target input. This will default to whatever the current position of the point is inside of the simulation when Selection is set to true. To get an updating position, you can use the Sample Position node to sample the position of a point in the simulation and then use that as the Target input.\nFor the Hook inputs, it will move the point to the Target over a certain amount of time, essentially exerting a force but one that is more stable. The higher the Decay value the quicker the rate of movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The inputs for hooking & pinning points in a simulation",

Even with the option of rendered view, there are multiple different rendering engines. Two rendering engines come pre-installed with Blender, with the possibility to use more. The two rendering engines that come pre-installed are Eevee and Cycles. By default Eevee is enabled, but you can change to Cycles in the Render Properties tab.\nEevee is much faster and more responsive than Cycles, but a lot of the time doesn’t ‘look as nice’. Eevee is a real-time rendering engine built for performance and interactivity, while Cycles is a path-traced rendering engine built for physically accurate light calculations. This is much slower to calculate but often results in ‘nicer’ lighting. Both rendering engines are excellent and are helpful in different scenarios depending on the desired outcomes.\nThe default style Atoms Cycles inside of Molecular Nodes is only visible inside of Cycles for performance reasons. All other styles are visible inside of both rendering engines. If your atoms seem to be invisible, check the rendering engine and style that you are using.\n\nIf you have the option available, ensure to switch to GPU Compute instead of CPU when using the Cycles render engine. This will usually always be the better option, and the perforamnce will be much better.\n\nVideo",

Instead we have to assign it a material. This material can have the property that it is primarily red, but it is also metallic, has a sheen, reflects light, can be partially transparent as well as a whole range of other properties.\nComplex shading is an entire career itself, so we won’t get too much in to it. In this example we will just add a material to the monkey to make it red, and a different material to the cube to make it blue.\n\nIf you can’t see the colors changing, ensure you are in Rendered view.\n\nIn the example below, we create a new material called Material.001 for the monkey which we change to red. The cube already has a material called Material. We change the material being used to the monkey’s material, before changing it back and editing the starting material so that it is blue.\nTry playing around with some of the other material settings, to see what effects you can create.\n\n\nVideo\nAssigning materials to objects.",

Each entity can have different annotation types supported.\nThe bundled annotation types for Trajectories are:\n\nadd_atom_info() - For some basic atom info\nadd_com() - For center-of-mass of a selection\nadd_com_distance() - For distance between two center-of-masses\nadd_canonical_dihedrals() - For canonical dihedrals of a residue\nadd_universe_info() - For universe info\nadd_label_2d() - For adding a generic 2d label in viewport / render\nadd_label_3d() - For adding a generic 3d label\n\nAll selections used in the annotation APIs can be either MDAnalysis selection phrases (strings) or instances of AtomGroups.\nHere is how to access the annotations manager of an entity:\n\n# annotations manager\nt.annotations\n\n&lt;molecularnodes.entities.trajectory.annotations.TrajectoryAnnotationManager at 0x34511e6d0&gt;\n\n\nAvailable annotation types can be seen as follows:\n\n# available annotation types\n[a for a in t.annotations.__dir__() if a.startswith(\"add_\")]\n\n['add_atom_info',\n 'add_com',\n 'add_com_distance',\n 'add_canonical_dihedrals',\n 'add_universe_info',\n 'add_simulation_box',\n 'add_label_2d',\n 'add_label_3d']\n\n\nEach annotation type can have different input parameters. A common parameter name can be passed to name the annotation for easier name based lookups later. All the parameters to the add_&lt;annotation_type&gt; method have to be keyword params.\nAnnotations can be added using the add_&lt;annotation_type&gt; method, which returns an instance that can be used to further customize the annotation. Annotation specific inputs as well as common annotation parameters can be customized.\nThe function signature for adding an annotation type can be seen as follows:\n\nt.annotations.add_atom_info.func.__signature__\n\n&lt;Signature (self, annotation_class, /, *, selection: str | MDAnalysis.core.groups.AtomGroup = 'name CA', show_resid: bool = False, show_segid: bool = False, name: str = None) -&gt; molecularnodes.annotations.interface.AnnotationInterface&gt;",

These custom annotation types will be automatically registered and can be added using the same add_&lt;annotation_type&gt; method of a trajectory instance. The GUI to add and configure the annotation will also be automatically available.\n\nCreate a custom annotation\nA custom trajectory annotation class has to extend TrajectoryAnnotation and implement the draw method. Optional defaults method can be used to set defaults for the annotation and a validate method that can validate inputs when they change can be implemented. The custom class will have access to the trajectory entity via self.trajectory, universe via self.trajectory.universe and the annotation params via self.interface. Please see the drawing utilities section for all the methods available to draw onto the viewport / renders from the draw code.\n\n# Add a CutomAnnotation class\n# This class will auto-register with the Trajectory entities\nclass CustomAnnotation(mn.entities.trajectory.TrajectoryAnnotation):\n    annotation_type = \"custom_annotation\"\n\n    selection: str  # required param\n    bool_param: bool = False  # optional bool param\n\n    # optional defaults method\n    def defaults(self) -&gt; None:\n        # any default settings for this annotation go here\n        params = self.interface\n        # set text size to 24\n        params.text_size = 20\n\n    # optional validate method\n    def validate(self, input_name: str = None) -&gt; bool:\n        # validate any input params that change (either through API or GUI)\n        # return True if validation succeeds else False or raise an Exception\n        params = self.interface\n        universe = self.trajectory.universe\n        # validate and save the selection atom group\n        if isinstance(params.selection, str):\n            # check if selection phrase is valid\n            # mda throws exception if invalid\n            self.atom_group = universe.select_atoms(params.selection)\n        elif isinstance(params.selection, AtomGroup):\n            self.atom_group = params.selection\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Need str or AtomGroup.

Common annotation param defaults and other initializations that need to be done once can be setup in this method.\n\n\nThe validate method\nThis method is called during annotation creation and every time an annotation input changes (both through the API and GUI). This method can raise and exception or return False when validation fails. On successful validations, this method should return True. In addition to validations, any values that require resetting due to input changes can be done in this method.\n\n\nThe draw method\nThis is the main draw method of the annotation that gets called multiple times as part of Blender’s 3D viewport draw handler and during rendering. It is important to only do the minimum required drawing stuff in this method to avoid viewport lag. The defaults and validate methods above can be used to setup all the required analysis classes and results that can be displayed in this method.\n\n\n\nAdd the custom annotation\n\nt.add_style(selection=\"resid 75\", style=\"ball_and_stick\")\n# add the custom annotation and pass the required selection parameter\nca = t.annotations.add_custom_annotation(selection=\"resid 75\")\nca\n\n&lt;molecularnodes.annotations.manager.CustomAnnotation_interface at 0x345c0c710&gt;\n\n\n\n# frame the view and render\ncanvas.frame_view(t.get_view(\"resid 75\"), viewpoint=\"front\")\ncanvas.snapshot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# hide the added annotation\nca.visible = False\n\n\n\nUnregister a custom annotation\nCustom annotations get automatically registered with the TrajectoryAnnotationManager. They can be manually unregistered and re-registered using the unregister_type and register_class methods if required.\n\n# unregister the annotation\nmanager = mn.entities.trajectory.TrajectoryAnnotationManager\nmanager.unregister_type(\"custom_annotation\")\n\n\n\nInput types\nCustom annotations can specify inputs that become automatically available to both the API and the GUI. For example, selection and bool_param are inputs for the custom annotation example above. Inputs are specified as class attributes with a Python annotation that specifies its type. In the example above, selection is of type str and bool_param is of type bool.\nHere are the supported types and their representation in Blender GUI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nRepresentation in Blender GUI\n\n\n\n\nstr\nString input\n\n\nbool\nBoolean checkbox\n\n\nint\nInteger input\n\n\nfloat\nFloat input\n\n\ntuple[float, float]\nA vector input in 2 dimensions\n\n\ntuple[float, float, float]\nA vector input in 3 dimensions\n\n\ntuple[float, float, float, float]\nA vector input in 4 dimensions. Input names that contain the word “color” will become Color selections\n\n\nlist[str]\nAn Enumeration drowpdown\n\n\n\n\n\nParam overrides\nText, lines and meshes drawn in custom annotations can be controlled by the same params as described in the Common Annotations Params section above. Custom annotations can also override these parameters to either hardcode specific values or allow additional customization though separate inputs. This can be done by passing the overrides keyword param to any of the drawing utilities and specify a dictionary of the parameters to override along with their values.\nHere is an example within a custom annotation that draws two 3D circles, the first with a hardcoded color value and the second with a custom input color:\n    ...\n    # custom line color input\n    line_color_input: tuple[float, float, float, float] = (1, 1, 1, 1)\n    ...\n    self.draw_circle_3d(\n        center,\n        radius,\n        normal_vector,\n        overrides={\"line_color\": (1.0, 0.498, 0.055, 1)},\n    )\n    self.draw_circle_3d(\n        center,\n        radius * 2,\n        normal_vector,\n        overrides={\"line_color\": self.interface.line_color_input},\n    )\n    ...\n\n\nDrawing utilities\nCustom annotations can use the drawing utilities available from the base annotation class to display text or drawings in the viewport / renders.\nThe following utility methods are currently available:\n\ndistance - Distance between two vectors\ndraw_text_2d - Draw text at a given 2D position (normalized co-ordinates) of Viewport.\ndraw_text_3d - Draw text at a given 3D position\ndraw_line_2d - Draw a line between two points (normalized co-ordinates) in 2D viewport space\ndraw_line_3d - Draw a line between two points in 3D space\ndraw_circle_2d - Draw a circle around a 2D point (normalized coordinate) in the viewport space\ndraw_circle_3d - Draw a circle around a 3D point in the plane perpendicular to the given normal\ndraw_sphere - Draw a sphere object at a 3D point\ndraw_cone - Draw a cone object along an axis\ndraw_cylinder - Draw a cylinder object along an axis\ndraw_n_sided_cylinder - Draw an n sided cylinder\ndraw_n_sided_pyramid - Draw an n sided pyramid\ndraw_triclinic_cell - Draw a triclinic cell\ndraw_wigner_seitz_cell - Draw a compact Wigner-Seitz cell\ndraw_bmesh - Draw a generic Blender BMesh\ndraw_bpy_image - Draw an image from bpy.data.images at the given 2D position (normalized co-ordinates) of Viewport.\nbpy_image_to_pil_image - Convert Blender image to PIL image\npil_image_to_bpy_image - Convert PIL image to Blender image\n\nThese methods can be used within the draw method of a custom annotation.

In the video example, the same calculation that is occurring internally inside of the MN_topo_edge_angle node, is being handled explicity by this node. If the Index is being used as Index B then the current point that is being evaluated is the centre of the angle calculation. If this value is changed, then the point at the corresponding index is used, which results in a smaller angle in the example video.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nAngle between the points around Index B in radians\nAngle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocket\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIndex A\n0\nFirst of the points for the angle calculation\n\n\nIndex B\n1\nThe middle point for the angle calculation\n\n\nIndex C\n2\nLast of the points for the angle calculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the angle that two points make, relative to the current point being evaluated. Points are selected based on their index, with the centre of the angle calculation being the current point’s position. Equivalent to using 3-Point angle and using Index as the Index B. In the example video, the angle calculation is similar to that of the 3-Point Angle node, but the middle point is always the current point.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nAngle of the line A -&gt; Self -&gt; C in radians\nAngle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocket\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\nThe Position vectors to use for the angle calculation\n\n\nIndex A\n0\nFirst end point for the angle calculation around the current point\n\n\nIndex B\n0\nThe Index for the middle point in the angle calculation, defaulting to the current point\n\n\nIndex C\n2\nLast end point for the angle calculation around the current point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the distance and the vector between the evaluating point and the point selected via the Index.

Molecular Nodes came about through experimentation with nodes, and there is no better way to learn the systems then to keep plugging and unplugging different sockets, changing values and tinkering.\nAt any point you can view the internals of the node groups that are included with Molecular Nodes. With a node selected, you can Tab to enter a selected node, and use Ctrl + Tab to exit the node group. You can also do the same by right clicking. Feel free to tweak the internals of node groups, but beware that changing one node group will change that node group for all othe uses of it. Starting a new Blender session will ensure that the node groups are fresh and ‘factor reset’.",

The “Edge Index” selects the edge from all possible connected edges. Edges are unfortunately stored somewhat randomly. The resulting information is between the evaluating point and the point that the edge is between. Point Index returns -1 if not connected. In the video example, cones are instanced on each point where the Edge Index returns a valid connection. The Edge Vector can be used to align the instanced cone along that edge. The length of the edge can be used to scale the cone to the other point. As the “Edge Index” is changed, the selected edge changes. When “Edge Index” == 3, only the atoms with 4 connections are selected, which in this model (1BNA) are just the phosphates.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nWhether there is a valid edge corresponding to the given index\nIs Valid\n\n\nThe index for the other point involved in this edge, -1 if not connected\nPoint Index\n\n\nThe position for the other point involved in this edge, (0, 0, 0) if not connected\nPoint Position\n\n\nThe index on the edge domain for the selected edge. -1 if not connected\nEdge Index\n\n\nThe vector along the selected edge.

For molecule bonds, combinations of [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] will select all possible bond angles. In the video example, two edges are selected with their “Edge Index” values. Those atoms which aren’t valid return false and do not get instanced. The two edge vectors are used to calculate the perpendicular vector through cross product, around which the rotation for the cone is rotated. This demonstrates the ability to calculate the edge angle between the two selected edges.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nBoth of the selected edges are valid\nIs Valid\n\n\nAngle between the two selected edges in radians.

If the connection doesn’t exist, or the connection is back to the original point, -1 is returned. In the video example, a new point is selected based on the “Edge Index”. At that point, all of the connecting points are exposed as indices 0, 1, 2, 3. If that index is not a valid point or connection, or the point is the same as the original point that is being evaluated, then -1 is returned. This is one of the more complicated topology nodes, but allows indexing of the atoms that are bonded to a bonded atom. This helps with doing calculations for planar molecules.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nIndex for the 0th point, connected to the point at the end of the selected edge.

Other data formats including electron microscopy (EM) .map, EM tomography files such as .map and .star, with the potential to support more data formats as well.\nSee the talk below at the 2022 Blender conference for an overview of the add-on it’s capabilities.\nMolecular Nodes provides the translation layer that allows importing of molecular data formats, while Blender provides the industry-leading animation and rendering tools to create visually stunning molecular graphics with ease.\nThe add-on runs on the Geometry Nodes procedural modelling and animation system inside of Blender, which gives the add-on speed and robustness with minimal user input required."

Next check out some of the tutorials, such as intro to blender, basics of downloading from the PDB or how to customise selections.\nThere are some outdated tutorials on YouTube about how to use the add-on also. MN has been developed further and improved since these videos, but the general workflow remains the same."

Importing every frame (interval = 1 ) will take long time to load, and balloon-out the save-file size of the .blend file. It’s best to work with some subset of the trajectory frames, and interpolate between them with Molecular Nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMolecular nodes is still surprisingly performant with thousands of frames loaded, but the .blend file takes a long time to save and load due to several GBs worth of data being save and loaded each time.\n\n\nFor this example we are going to import every 10th frame.\n\n\n2.2 Click ‘Import Frames’ and Wait\nMolecular Nodes is working through a lot of data, so this load step can take a few minutes - be patient. Once it’s all loaded, the structure along with the atomic properties are available for use inside of Geometry Nodes!\n\n\n2.3 Click space to play the animation.\nEnsure to change over to Cycles & rendered view to view the coloured atoms, but otherwise the animation should be playing if press space!\nJust Points\nVideo\nRendered View In this scene I additionally added a Sun light.\nVideo\n\n\n2.4 Geometry Nodes\nNow that the animation is imported into geometry nodes, you can work with the points as you would otherwise.\nTry applying some noise, or in this example, scaling the points to 0 based on the proximity to an empty.\nVideo"

    "text": "Operators\n\nMost internal operators require the context to be set correctly before they are invoked. bpy.context.temp_override can be used. Since there can be multiple windows with different areas and regions within, it is always safe to iterate through all for the required window/area/region before setting the context so that everything is updated correctly\nwindow_manager.invoke_confirm in an operator’s invoke is used for confirmation dialogs. window_manager.invoke_props_dialog in an operator’s invoke is used to show a dialog with the operator properties. An explicit draw method can be used to customize the layout of what is shown\nThe execute method of operators can be directly invoked (bypassing invoke etc) using the first param as EXEC_DEFAULT - this is very useful in tests to test operators. EXEC_INVOKE can be used to directly call the operator and run it’s invoke method\nThe most common way to delete an object is to select it and then call an operator like bpy.ops.object.delete(). This can be problematic at times if the view layer is not up to date and whatever is the active object will get deleted. A better way is to explicitly delete the object using bpy.data.objects.remove and passing the object. Avoid using operators if the same can be achieved in a different way. Operators are both slow and can be asynchronous with different context requirements\nBlender does not allow dynamic properties in an operator. To achieve dynamic properties in an operator (to show in the invoke UI for example), a temporary operator has to be created, registered with Blender and invoked. A dynamic PropertyGroup with dynamic properties can be created using the type() method. This dynamic type can be used within a PointerProperty of the temporary operator for dynamic inputs\nbpy.types.Operator.__subclasses__() and bpy.types.PropertyGroup.__subclasses__() can be used to verify whether temporary operators and property groups are being unregistered and garbage collected. sys.getrefcount can be used on a class to get the reference counts",

    "text": "Viewport\n\nAn object’s hide_viewport property is not animatable. To support visibility changes that are animatable, a custom property (with get and set callbacks) that controls both the viewport and rendering visibility works better\nAn object’s visible_get() method to get whether the object is visible or not can throw a ReferenceError: StructRNA of type Object has been removed exception at times - one such case is when the object is selected and moved in the viewport using the g operator\nbpy.context.object and bpy.context.active_object are not necessarily interchangeable. The Context Access page specifies the contexts in which the properties are available. One key point to note is that when an object is active, but hidden, bpy.context.active_object will be None. So, even though bpy.context.object is available for use in panels, the active_object property could be useful to distinguish between the active but hidden cases\nThe view_matrix of Blender’s region data can be used to determine the distance of a 3D point to the virtual 3D viewport camera. This works for both the othographic and the more common perspective projection modes. A range of the distance values for an object can be determined by calculating the min and max of the object’s bounding box vertices (8 of them). This allows for a really fast way to determine on a normalized scale how far a point in the object space is from the 3D viewport. We use this to adjust the text size of annotations to create a perception of depth.\nBlender uses a bit of magic math to display the camera view outline in the 3D viewport. The actual camera width and height shown and the position can be determined based on the view_camera_zoom and view_camera_offset params of the region’s 3d data. There is also a dependency on the viewport aspect ratio\nBlender’s camera_to_view_selected (bpy.ops.view3d.camera_to_view_selected()) is a great way to frame a selection. Care should be taken to ensure only what is required is selected (and restored) before calling this operator\nViewport rendering uses OpenGL (bpy.ops.render.opengl). OpenGL context is not setup in the background (-b) mode, which is the same when using the bpy module in headless mode\nMost Blender crashes are due to accessing something before the viewport got updated. Ensuring that the viewport is redrawn eliminates most of these crashes. bpy.ops.wm.redraw_timer(type='DRAW_WIN_SWAP', iterations=1) as outlined in the Blender Gotchas page is one quick way, but is not guaranteed compatibility in future. Timers/Handlers/Modals are other recommended ways\nForce redrawing viewport using bpy.ops.wm.redraw_timer(type='DRAW_WIN_SWAP', iterations=1) doesn’t work in background mode - don’t use it in that mode",

    "text": "Rendering and PIL\n\nBlender’s current default font is Inter (4.x onwards) - the font files are in the datafiles/fonts directory. PIL needs access to the font file to display text\nPIL does not have anti-aliasing for lines drawn using ImageDraw.line. The only alternatives are to have a custom implementation of anti-aliasing or draw to a bigger image and resize using Image.resize using the resample set to something like Resampling.LANCZOS. For the later, font sizes and line widths have to be adjusted accordingly\nPIL’s textbbox can be used to get the bounding box - to determine the text width / height\nPIL’s co-ordinate system is from the top left, where as Blender’s 3D viewport is from bottom left\nPIL does not have text rotation support. The recommendation for this support is to draw the text on a separate image, rotate the image and paste it - not ideal\nBlender’s object_utils.world_to_camera_view (from bpy_extras) can directly be used to get the corresponding 2D coords of a 3D point in the camera space for rendering\nIn the render mode, we can use the inverted value of the world matrix (camera.matrix_world.inverted()) as the view matrix for any computations\nMost of what is available through operators for Blender’s Video Sequence Editor (like bpy.ops.sequencer.image_strip_add) can be done through API as well (scene.sequence_editor_create), which has the added advantage that it is faster and doesn’t require the context to be present\nImages appended to an image strip using elements.append will only have to pass the base name of the images and not the full path\nVideo sequence editor has to be created (and deleted after generating the video) after rendering all the frames, else it will interfere with the rendering as it has higher precedence, so they must be cleared if setup temporarily\nSetting bpy.context.scene.render.use_lock_interface (equivalent of Render &gt; Lock Interface in the UI) seems to help, which prevents viewport updates while rendering\nbpy.context.scene.view_settings.view_transform = \"Standard\", which is the equivalent of Color Management &gt; View Transform in Render/Output properties seems to generate sharper viewport render images. The default from Blender 4.0 is AgX. If annotations with white (1, 1, 1, 1) don’t show up as such in renders, this is the reason\nbpy.data.images[\"Render Result\"] cannot be accessed to get the raw pixels of the render output. An alternative is to attach a Viewer Node in the compositor and access the pixels. However, the pixel values aren’t entirely between 0 and 1 and hence cannot be converted to a PIL image, etc. As outlined here the viewer node output isn’t color corrected etc. So there is no way of accessing the raw bytes (that match the file output) before it is written out to a file\nPIL images have to be flipped (numpy.flipud) for use as bpy.data.images in compositor",

The workaround is to do the updates in a one off timer (bpy.app.timers.register(_update_func, first_interval=0.001)). An alternative is also described in the Application Timers page. It is best to not have the node tree structurally change during the rendering process\nNode Group instances can be decoupled from one another by simply making a copy of the node tree - this is also equivalent to making a data block as single-user in Blender. This allows changes to each of the node groups to be independent of others\nPanel placeholders in a Blender’s Geometry Node provide a way to add inputs so that when inputs are iterated, they are iterated in a required order. Dynamically adding a new socket at a specific position isn’t straightforward\nThere doesn’t seem to be an easy way to link a Geometry Node input to a specific material setting (like say the use_backface_culling)\nUsing Ctrl when placing nodes in the Geometry Nodes editor will ensure snapping to the grid and avoid node locations having floating point values\nBoth the Geometry Node editor and Composite editor have the same area type (NODE_EDITOR), so the tree type in the context’s space data (context.space_data.tree_type) has to be used to distinguish between them (eg: CompositorNodeTree for Composite editor)\nThe only way to find nodes that belong to a particular frame is by checking the parent property of all nodes.

For example, to detect active object changes, bpy.msgbus.subscribe_rna has to be used for the key (bpy.types.LayerObjects, \"active\"). This works for all RNA properties (builtin ones and custom ones) and won’t work for ID properties\nAny object can be used as a owner for Blender’s msgbus subscriptions using bpy.msgbus.subscribe_rna. Using a owner allows to clear all subscriptions by the owner using bpy.msgbus.clear_by_owner\nBlender has a concept of Restricted Context during an extension’s register() and unregister() methods that limits what is available during those methods. For example, the scene entity does not exist in bpy.context in these cases\nBlender’s openvdb support uses nanogrid to check and warn for leaks. Any vdb grids created must be ensured they are cleaned up to avoid memory errors, especially in pytests\nBlender seems to have some wierd caching of contents loaded from vdb files. Overwriting a vdb file that is already loaded and re-loading it as a new object will update the old object as well\nThere is no separate font styling support in Blender (like Bold, Italic etc) - the corresponding font file has to be loaded if that is needed (using blf.load)\nFonts loaded using blf.load have to be unloaded using blf.unload with the same font file as the param and not the returned font id from the load\nFor text and lines drawn using blf/gpu modules, there is a font size and line width discrepancy that depends on the screen resolution. Apparently Blender uses a dpi of 72 internally. bpy.context.preferences.system.dpi and bpy.context.preferences.system.pixel_size have the dpi and pixel size data. (MacOS retina has 144/2 and regular ones 72/1) Text/line widths have to be scaled accordingly\nA set of vertices can be turned to an object using from_pydata of bpy.data.meshes that can be used to create bounding box objects\nbpy.utils.expose_bundled_modules() is needed to access Blender’s bundled openvdb package in the background mode (bpy)\nBlender app handlers (like frame_change_post, etc) are easy to add, but not straightforward to remove. Using the clear will remove all handlers, which is not desirable. The alternative is to remove by using the actual handler name (the function name)\nAlways use Blender’s portable installation to keep environments separate and clean\nNever keep references to Blender data.

This is useful for doing analysis ‘on-the-fly’ and even getting access to timesteps that would normally be discarded when saving to disk for size constraints.\nThanks to MDAnalysis handling everything ‘under the hood’ - we can also stream these results directly into Blender using Molecular Nodes.\nThis example uses the 2025 IMD workshop materials which provides example code for setting up and running a simulation that provide results for streaming. The simulation I show below is the example GROMACS simulation.\nStreaming isn’t supported in a GROMACS release at time of writing (but will be soon) - I followed these instructions for how to compile it myself with the new IMDClient functionality.",

    "text": "Connecting to the Simulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental\n\n\n\nConnecting to streaming trajectories in MN should still be considered experimental. As it becomes more mature in the simulation packages themselves we should be able to better decide on how this should all work.\n\n\nOnce we have a simulation that is up and running, we can import it to Molecular Nodes like we would a normal trajecotry. For the coordinates, instead of a filepath we give the IMD streaming server. By default on your own machine it will be imd://localhost:8889.\nAfter we load the trajectory, every time the frame changes inside of Blender it will fetch the latest frame from the simulation and the 3D model will be updated.\nVideo\nIf the simulation is dependent on GO / PAUSE orders then pausing Blender will pause the simulation, but we could just as easily link this to a running simulation which doesn’t wait for us and just visually inspect / render some frames from the simulation as it runs.\nEverything inside of Molecular Nodes like adding styles & selections should all work as normal, just that the positions come from a currently updating simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\nIf you scrub around on the timeline (move to the first frame) it will still advance to the next frame in the simulation. There is no caching of positions currently enabled so even going back in ‘time’ will move forward in time for the simulation.\n\n\n\nPotential Features\nLike said above - this is very experimental. Potential features could be: - caching some number of frames of the simulation so that scrubbing back N number of frames does acces old positions rather than always fetching new ones - IMD protocol supports sending forces back to the simulation. We could interact with the simulation via Blender\nIf you have other suggestions of questions around it, please open an issue or discussion on the GitHub page and discuss it there.",

We can duplicate the structure with Shift + D in the 3D viewport, and change the node group used so that it displays the atoms rather than applying a style.\nVideo\nIn the demo video, we duplicate the object. When duplicating, both objects are using the same node tree, so we then also duplicate the node tree.

The original structure object remains unchanged and still contains a node tree which applies the ribbon style.\nIf you want to change the colors which are applied to the surface, we change the node tree of the object which contains the atoms.
