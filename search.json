The “Edge Index” selects the edge from all possible connected edges. Edges are unfortunately stored somewhat randomly. The resulting information is between the evaluating point and the point that the edge is between.

The Edge Vector can be used to align the instanced cone along that edge. The length of the edge can be used to scale the cone to the other point.

These points are selected based on their index in the point domain, with Index B being the centre of the calculation.\nIn the video example, the same calculation that is occurring internally inside of the MN_topo_edge_angle node, is being handled explicity by this node. If the Index is being used as Index B then the current point that is being evaluated is the centre of the angle calculation.

If you wish to change how a node behaves, you can Tab into the node group to change the internals, and Ctrl + Tab to leave the node group.\nThe nodes are shared between node trees, so if you change the internals of the ‘Cartoon’ node then this will change how it works for every node tree in your .blend file. If you wish to create changes that are only for a single node tree, you can create a copy of it first before making changes by doing the following:\n\nRight click on the node and select Show / Hide -&gt; Node Options\nClick the Make Copy icon to the right of the node group’s name\nIt will create a duplicate node group called MN_style_cartoon.001 for example, which you can now freely edit without changing the other MN_style_cartoon node groups.",

    "text": "Streaming vs In Memory\n\nStreaming\nThe default option will associate an MDAnlaysis session with the read topology file. This will stream the topology from disk, as the frame in the scene inside of Blender changes. If the original topology or trajectory files are moved, this will break the connection to the data. This is the most performant option, but will potentially break if changing computers.\nBelow is an example of importing a trajectory, by streaming the frames. As the frame changes in the scene, the loaded frame is updated on the imported protein, based on the created MDAnalysis session. Interpolation between frames is currently not supported with this import method.\nThe MDAnalysis session will be saved when the .blend file is saved, and should be restored when the .blend file is reopened.\nVideo\n\n\nIn Memory\nThe In Memory option will load all frames of the trajectory in to memory, and store them as objects inside of the MN_data collection in the scene. This will ensure that all of the associated data is stored inside of the .blend file for portability, but will come at the cost of performance for very large trajectories. It also breaks the connection to the underlying MDAnalysis session, which limits the ability to further tweak the trajectory after import.\nIf In Memory is selected, the frames are imported as individual objects and stored in a MN_data collection. The interpolation between frames is then handled by nodes inside of Geometry Nodes, which aren’t necessarily linked to the scene frame.\nThis will create a larger .blend file and can lead to some performance drops with large trajectories, but ensures all of the data is kept within the saved file, and can enable further creative control through Geometry Nodes.\nAll connection to the underlying MDAnalysis session is lost on import, and the selections and trajectory cannot changed. To make changes you must reimport the trajectory.\nVideo",

You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\nThe data flows like a river, along the green noodles of the node graph. There must be only 1 final output.

If there is not colour in the structure, ensure that the node has a material MOL_atomic_material at the bottom of the node.\n\nThe data flows through the node graph from left to right.

All of the styles are the result of the same data manipulation.\nThe node graph in between can be as complex as you want to make it, as long as there is a continuous connection to the output of the geometry, it should produce a result.\n\n\n\nAn example of a more complex node graph, with multiple branches that diverge and come back together.\n\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\nThe data flows through the node tree from left to right, along the bright green lines. The atomic data comes in, goes through layers of manipulation, a style is applied, and the created geometry is then outputted from the node tree.\n\nEditing the Styles\nTo change how each style looks, you can edit the default values of the nodes. By changing the values, you change the numbers that are used in the creation of the 3D models. The style will only change if it is being output through the node tree. You can click and drag to change the values smoothly. You can hold Shift while dragging the values to change them more accurately.\n\n\nVideo\nTweaking the default values of the styles.",

The good thing however is that these selections can always be updated and tweaked. They can even be created procedurally based on the values of other selections or animations.\nIn the example video below we are using the selection to apply the Atoms style. We can change the residues and chains that are selected by ticking and unticking the boxes. Each of these selections also take a field input, so they can use the output of other selection nodes. The selections from the two nodes are being combined with the Boolean Math node set to And. Other boolean math operations are also available.\nVideo",

The addition of this node creates a new object called Empty_Cube which we can transform by Grabbing, Rotating and Scaling to change what is inside of the cube.

Even with the option of rendered view, there are multiple different rendering engines. Two rendering engines come pre-installed with Blender, with the possibility to use more. The two rendering engines that come pre-installed are Eevee and Cycles. By default Eevee is enabled, but you can change to Cycles in the Render Properties tab.\nEevee is much faster and more responsive than Cycles, but a lot of the time doesn’t ‘look as nice’. Eevee is a real-time rendering engine built for performance and interactivity, while Cycles is a path-traced rendering engine built for physically accurate light calculations. This is much slower to calculate but often results in ‘nicer’ lighting. Both rendering engines are excellent and are helpful in different scenarios depending on the desired outcomes.\nThe default style Atoms Cycles inside of Molecular Nodes is only visible inside of Cycles for performance reasons. All other styles are visible inside of both rendering engines. If your atoms seem to be invisible, check the rendering engine and style that you are using.\n\nIf you have the option available, ensure to switch to GPU Compute instead of CPU when using the Cycles render engine. This will usually always be the better option, and the perforamnce will be much better.\n\nVideo",

In this example we will just add a material to the monkey to make it red, and a different material to the cube to make it blue.\n\nIf you can’t see the colors changing, ensure you are in Rendered view.\n\nIn the example below, we create a new material called Material.001 for the monkey which we change to red. The cube already has a material called Material. We change the material being used to the monkey’s material, before changing it back and editing the starting material so that it is blue.\nTry playing around with some of the other material settings, to see what effects you can create.\n\n\nVideo\nAssigning materials to objects.",
