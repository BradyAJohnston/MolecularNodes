Even with the option of rendered view, there are multiple different rendering engines. Two rendering engines come pre-installed with Blender, with the possibility to use more. The two rendering engines that come pre-installed are Eevee and Cycles. By default Eevee is enabled, but you can change to Cycles in the Render Properties tab.\nEevee is much faster and more responsive than Cycles, but a lot of the time doesn’t ‘look as nice’. Eevee is a real-time rendering engine built for performance and interactivity, while Cycles is a path-traced rendering engine built for physically accurate light calculations. This is much slower to calculate but often results in ‘nicer’ lighting. Both rendering engines are excellent and are helpful in different scenarios depending on the desired outcomes.\nThe default style Atoms Cycles inside of Molecular Nodes is only visible inside of Cycles for performance reasons. All other styles are visible inside of both rendering engines. If your atoms seem to be invisible, check the rendering engine and style that you are using.\n\nIf you have the option available, ensure to switch to GPU Compute instead of CPU when using the Cycles render engine. This will usually always be the better option, and the perforamnce will be much better.\n\nVideo",

Instead we have to assign it a material. This material can have the property that it is primarily red, but it is also metallic, has a sheen, reflects light, can be partially transparent as well as a whole range of other properties.\nComplex shading is an entire career itself, so we won’t get too much in to it. In this example we will just add a material to the monkey to make it red, and a different material to the cube to make it blue.\n\nIf you can’t see the colors changing, ensure you are in Rendered view.\n\nIn the example below, we create a new material called Material.001 for the monkey which we change to red. The cube already has a material called Material. We change the material being used to the monkey’s material, before changing it back and editing the starting material so that it is blue.\nTry playing around with some of the other material settings, to see what effects you can create.\n\n\nVideo\nAssigning materials to objects.",

A sub-selection of the Target atoms can be used if the Selection input is used. You can expand the selection to include an entire residue if a single atom in that residue is selected, by setting Whole Residue to True. In the example below, the MN_style_atoms is being applied to a selection, which is being calculated from the proximity of atoms to specific chains. As the cutoff for the selection is changed, it includes or excludes more atoms.

The “Edge Index” selects the edge from all possible connected edges. Edges are unfortunately stored somewhat randomly. The resulting information is between the evaluating point and the point that the edge is between. Point Index returns -1 if not connected.\nIn the video example, cones are instanced on each point where the Edge Index returns a valid connection. The Edge Vector can be used to align the instanced cone along that edge. The length of the edge can be used to scale the cone to the other point. As the “Edge Index” is changed, the selected edge changes. When “Edge Index” == 3, only the atoms with 4 connections are selected, which in this model (1BNA) are just the phosphates.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nEdge Index\nInt\nIndex within the gorup of edges that are connected to this point\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nIs Valid\nBool\nWhether there is a valid edge corresponding to the given index\nFalse\n\n\nPoint Index\nInt\nThe index for the other point involved in this edge, -1 if not connected\n-1\n\n\nPoint Position\nVector\nThe position for the other point involved in this edge, (0, 0, 0) if not connected\n[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n\nEdge Index\nInt\nThe index on the edge domain for the selected edge. -1 if not connected\n-1\n\n\nEdge Vector\nVector\nThe vector along the selected edge.

For molecule bonds, combinations of [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] will select all possible bond angles.\nIn the video example, two edges are selected with their “Edge Index” values. Those atoms which aren’t valid return false and do not get instanced. The two edge vectors are used to calculate the perpendicular vector through cross product, around which the rotation for the cone is rotated. This demonstrates the ability to calculate the edge angle between the two selected edges.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nEdge A\nInt\nIndex within the gorup of edges that are connected to this point\n0\n\n\nEdge B\nInt\nIndex within the gorup of edges that are connected to this point\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nIs Valid\nBool\nWhether both edges are valid corresponding to the given indices and are not the same\nFalse\n\n\nAngle\nFloat\nAngle between the two selected edges in radians.

At that point, all of the connecting points are exposed as indices 0, 1, 2, 3. If that index is not a valid point or connection, or the point is the same as the original point that is being evaluated, then -1 is returned.\nThis is one of the more complicated topology nodes, but allows indexing of the atoms that are bonded to a bonded atom.

For molecule bonds, combinations of [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] will select all possible bond angles.\nIn the video example, two edges are selected with their “Edge Index” values. Those atoms which aren’t valid return false and do not get instanced. The two edge vectors are used to calculate the perpendicular vector through cross product, around which the rotation for the cone is rotated. This demonstrates the ability to calculate the edge angle between the two selected edges.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nEdge A\nInt\nIndex within the gorup of edges that are connected to this point\n0\n\n\nEdge B\nInt\nIndex within the gorup of edges that are connected to this point\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nIs Valid\nBool\nWhether both edges are valid corresponding to the given indices and are not the same\nFalse\n\n\nAngle\nFloat\nAngle between the two selected edges in radians.

If the connection doesn’t exist, or the connection is back to the original point, -1 is returned.\nIn the video example, a new point is selected based on the “Edge Index”. At that point, all of the connecting points are exposed as indices 0, 1, 2, 3. If that index is not a valid point or connection, or the point is the same as the original point that is being evaluated, then -1 is returned.\nThis is one of the more complicated topology nodes, but allows indexing of the atoms that are bonded to a bonded atom. This helps with doing calculations for planar molecules.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nEdge Index\nInt\nIndex within the gorup of edges that are connected to this point\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n0\nInt\nIndex for the 0th point, connected to the point at the end of the selected edge.

The backbone positions can also be selected from the AA residue higher or lower with the specified offset.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nOffset\nInt\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nO\nVector\n\n[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n\nC\nVector\n\n[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n\nCA\nVector\n\n[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n\nN\nVector\n\n[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGets the backbone positions for each AA residue and stores them as attributes, and additionally computes the phi and psi angles for each residue in radians.\nIn the video example, the Phi and Psi angles are mapped from (-Pi, Pi) to (0, 1), which is used in the Color Ramp node to choose colors. This is computed on the alpha carbons, but can be used on any of the resulting atoms for the corresponding residues, which is shown in the second video.\nVideo\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nAtoms\nGeometry\nThe atomic geometry, contiaining backbone peptide atoms to compute Phi and Psi angles\nrequired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nAtoms\nGeometry\nAll of the Atomic Geometry, with the Phi & Psi attributes assigned to all corresponding atoms\nrequired\n\n\nAlpha Carbons\nGeometry\nJust the alpha carbons, with the computed Phi and Psi angles\nrequired\n\n\nPhi\nFloat\nCompute Phi angle for the AA in radians\n0.0\n\n\nPsi\nFloat\nCompute Psi angle for the AA in radians\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the angle between 3 different points. These points are selected based on their index in the point domain, with Index B being the centre of the calculation.\nIn the video example, the same calculation that is occurring internally inside of the MN_topo_edge_angle node, is being handled explicity by this node. If the Index is being used as Index B then the current point that is being evaluated is the centre of the angle calculation. If this value is changed, then the point at the corresponding index is used, which results in a smaller angle in the example video.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nIndex A\nInt\nFirst of the points for the angle calculation\n0\n\n\nIndex B\nInt\nThe middle point for the angle calculation\n1\n\n\nIndex C\nInt\nLast of the points for the angle calculation\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nAngle\nFloat\nAngle between the points around Index B in radians\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the angle that two points make, relative to the current point being evaluated. Points are selected based on their index, with the centre of the angle calculation being the current point’s position. Equivalent to using 3-Point angle and using Index as the Index B.\nIn the example video, the angle calculation is similar to that of the 3-Point Angle node, but the middle point is always the current point.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nIndex A\nInt\nFirst end point for the angle calculation around the current point\n0\n\n\nIndex C\nInt\nLast end point for the angle calculation around the current point\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nType\nDescription\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nAngle\nFloat\nAngle of the line A -&gt; Self -&gt; C in radians\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the distance and the vector between the evaluating point and the point selected via the Index.\nIn the example video, each point is calculating a vector and a distance between itself and the indexed point.

More detail on each option is further in this tutorial, but the short descriptions:\n\nStyle Tick box whether to set up nodes to apply a style, or just import the data. If enabled, a default style to be applied on import is selected. This can be changed easily after import.\nImport Filter a MDAnalysis selection string to filter the topology when importing. Default is to import everything, but you can input strings such as ‘protein’ to only import the protein component.\nIn Memory Whether to load the selected frames (from start to stop, incrementing by step) into memory and discard the MDAnalysis session when importing.

The model will appear in the scene, and once you change frame in the scene, it will update the frame displayed in the viewport.\nVideo\n\nChanging Style\nYou can change the style by altering the Style nodes that are use inside of the node tree.\nAs you can see in the example, if we don’t apply the style, we can view just the raw atomic data that is being updated. Depending on which nodes we use to process that data, we can create different styles of further animations.\nVideo\n\n\nSubframes\nBy default, each frame on the timeline matches directly with the frames in the loaded trajectory.\nYou can add subframes which then tell Blender to add additional frames in between, which linearly interpolate between positions. This can slow down the animation and sometimes make it easier to view. The subframes for the trajectory can be adjusted in the Object section of the Molecular Nodes panel.\nThe Frame number in Blender no longer directly matches the frame displayed from the trajectory, with the trajectory playing back ‘slower’ than previously.\nVideo",

    "text": "Streaming vs In Memory\n\nStreaming\nThe default option will associate an MDAnlaysis session with the read topology file. This will stream the topology from disk, as the frame in the scene inside of Blender changes. If the original topology or trajectory files are moved, this will break the connection to the data. This is the most performant option, but will potentially break if changing computers.\nBelow is an example of importing a trajectory, by streaming the frames. As the frame changes in the scene, the loaded frame is updated on the imported protein, based on the created MDAnalysis session. Interpolation between frames is currently not supported with this import method.\nThe MDAnalysis session will be saved when the .blend file is saved, and should be restored when the .blend file is reopened.\nVideo\n\n\nIn Memory\nThe In Memory option will load all frames of the trajectory in to memory, and store them as objects inside of the MN_data collection in the scene. This will ensure that all of the associated data is stored inside of the .blend file for portability, but will come at the cost of performance for very large trajectories. It also breaks the connection to the underlying MDAnalysis session, which limits the ability to further tweak the trajectory after import.\nIf In Memory is selected, the frames are imported as individual objects and stored in a MN_data collection. The interpolation between frames is then handled by nodes inside of Geometry Nodes, which aren’t necessarily linked to the scene frame.\nThis will create a larger .blend file and can lead to some performance drops with large trajectories, but ensures all of the data is kept within the saved file, and can enable further creative control through Geometry Nodes.\nAll connection to the underlying MDAnalysis session is lost on import, and the selections and trajectory cannot changed. To make changes you must reimport the trajectory.\nVideo",

To download one of the datasets, use the code below:\n# pip install MDAnalysisData\nfrom MDAnalysisData import datasets\ndatasets.fetch_adk_transitions_FRODA()\n\nLoading the Trajectory\nWe will load the trajectory, and load all of the frame sin to memory to ensure we can make a smoother trajectory.\nIn the video below we have imported the trajectory, and we can adjust the number of frames in the scene, as well as the number of frames the trajectory will play back over. We also enabled EEVEE atoms to display in the EEVEE render engine.\nVideo\n\nChanging Styles\nWe can change the style of the imported trajectory, by adding a new style node. We can combine styles with the Join Geometry. For more details on adding styles, see the (importing)[01_importing.qmd] tutorial.\nVideo\nWe can apply the atoms style, only to the side chains of the protein, by using the Backbone selection node, and using the is_side_chain output. This selectively applies the style to only those atoms in the selection. The combined styles now contain only the atoms for the side chains and a continuous ribbon for the protein.\nVideo\n\n\n\nSetting the Scene\nWe can set up the scene a bit nicer with a backdrop. In this case we create a plane using Shift + A to add a plane, go in to edit mode and extrude the backbdrop up with the E key. We can create a slightly curved corner by bevelling the corner. Select the two vertices of the edge and click Ctrl + B. Move the mouse and use the scroll wheel to adjust the settings, then left click to apply.\nVideo\n\n\nRendering the Animation\nWe can change some final settings of the style, do a test Render Image, change the export settings for where the frames of the animation are going to be saved, then we can click Render Animation to render all of the frames of the animation.\nVideo",

    "text": "Geometry Nodes Editor\nThis is where we edit the node graph for Molecular Nodes. The node graph is a geometry processing program you create, that is read and executed by Blender from left to right. Each node performs an action on the geometry that is passed into it, and the result of that action is passed out to the right. Think of it as creating a set of rules for the computer to follow. You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\nThe data flows like a river, along the green noodles of the node graph. There must be only 1 final output. If you are using the molecular data, then there must also be a single input.\n\n\n\nExample node tree, demonstrating the flow of information through the nodes.\n\n\nThe data flows from left to right, like water through a river.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n  B --&gt; D(Style)\n  D --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Geometry Nodes workspace.\n\n\nThe starting style MOL_style_atoms_cycles is only visible via inside of the Cycles render engine. You can add other styles manipulate the data through other nodes, by adding them with Shift + A and navigating to the MolecularNodes panel at the bottom. There are several categories of nodes for different animations and styles. You can add the Ribbon Protein node, which will create a ribbon representation based on the alpha carbons in the structure. If there is not colour in the structure, ensure that the node has a material MOL_atomic_material at the bottom of the node.\n\nThe data flows through the node graph from left to right. There should always be one input, which is the atomic data that is stored in the 3D mesh of the atoms and bonds. There should also be only one output, which is the final geometry that has been created throughout the node graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n\n  B --&gt; D(Style 1)\n  B --&gt; E(Style 2)\n  B --&gt; S(Style 3)\n\n  sS[Selection] --&gt; S\n\n  E --&gt; F[Join\\nGeometry]\n  D --&gt; F\n  S --&gt; F\n\n  F --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the diagram, the flow of the data can split across multiple different branches of the tree, with the result of each parallel computation being combined before being exported.\nEach of these different branches can be a different style, in this example shown two different styles are applied, and the third style has a custom selection. All of the styles are the result of the same data manipulation.\nThe node graph in between can be as complex as you want to make it, as long as there is a continuous connection to the output of the geometry, it should produce a result.\n\n\n\nAn example of a more complex node graph, with multiple branches that diverge and come back together.\n\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\nThe data flows through the node tree from left to right, along the bright green lines. The atomic data comes in, goes through layers of manipulation, a style is applied, and the created geometry is then outputted from the node tree.\n\nEditing the Styles\nTo change how each style looks, you can edit the default values of the nodes. By changing the values, you change the numbers that are used in the creation of the 3D models. The style will only change if it is being output through the node tree. You can click and drag to change the values smoothly. You can hold Shift while dragging the values to change them more accurately.\n\n\nVideo\nTweaking the default values of the styles.",
