The outputs of these are are a boolean True / False for each atom. The logical test being performed depends on the node. To recreate the selection above, we can use the Select Chain and Select Res Name nodes.\n\n\n\nReplicating the same selection in Molecular Nodes\n\n\nThis might initially seem quite verbose. The good thing however is that these selections can always be updated and tweaked. They can even be created procedurally based on the values of other selections or animations.\nIn the example video below we are using the selection to apply the Atoms style. We can change the residues and chains that are selected by ticking and unticking the boxes. Each of these selections also take a field input, so they can use the output of other selection nodes. The selections from the two nodes are being combined with the Boolean Math node set to And. Other boolean math operations are also available.\nVideo",

The node graph is a geometry processing program you create, that is read and executed by Blender from left to right. Each node performs an action on the geometry that is passed into it, and the result of that action is passed out to the right. Think of it as creating a set of rules for the computer to follow. You define the rules, and the computer can follow those same rules, even if you start with a different data set.\nThe data flows like a river, along the green noodles of the node graph. There must be only 1 final output. If you are using the molecular data, then there must also be a single input.\n\n\n\nExample node tree, demonstrating the flow of information through the nodes.\n\n\nThe data flows from left to right, like water through a river.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n  B --&gt; D(Style)\n  D --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Geometry Nodes workspace.\n\n\nThe starting style MOL_style_atoms_cycles is only visible via inside of the Cycles render engine. You can add other styles manipulate the data through other nodes, by adding them with Shift + A and navigating to the MolecularNodes panel at the bottom. There are several categories of nodes for different animations and styles. You can add the Ribbon Protein node, which will create a ribbon representation based on the alpha carbons in the structure. If there is not colour in the structure, ensure that the node has a material MOL_atomic_material at the bottom of the node.\n\nThe data flows through the node graph from left to right. There should always be one input, which is the atomic data that is stored in the 3D mesh of the atoms and bonds. There should also be only one output, which is the final geometry that has been created throughout the node graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Atomic\\nData} --&gt; B[Manipulation]\n\n  B --&gt; D(Style 1)\n  B --&gt; E(Style 2)\n  B --&gt; S(Style 3)\n\n  sS[Selection] --&gt; S\n\n  E --&gt; F[Join\\nGeometry]\n  D --&gt; F\n  S --&gt; F\n\n  F --&gt; G{Geometry\\nOutput}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the diagram, the flow of the data can split across multiple different branches of the tree, with the result of each parallel computation being combined before being exported.\nEach of these different branches can be a different style, in this example shown two different styles are applied, and the third style has a custom selection. All of the styles are the result of the same data manipulation.\nThe node graph in between can be as complex as you want to make it, as long as there is a continuous connection to the output of the geometry, it should produce a result.\n\n\n\nAn example of a more complex node graph, with multiple branches that diverge and come back together.\n\n\nCombining multiple different nodes you can create protein models and complex 3D scenes. In the example below, there is a node tree which should be present on every new structure imported via MolecularNodes. The atoms and bonds are passed in from the left, the atoms are given a colour based on their element and their chain_id, and then the atoms are styled as atoms, scaling the atom radii to 1.00.\nThe data flows through the node tree from left to right, along the bright green lines. The atomic data comes in, goes through layers of manipulation, a style is applied, and the created geometry is then outputted from the node tree.\n\nEditing the Styles\nTo change how each style looks, you can edit the default values of the nodes. By changing the values, you change the numbers that are used in the creation of the 3D models. The style will only change if it is being output through the node tree. You can click and drag to change the values smoothly. You can hold Shift while dragging the values to change them more accurately.\n\n\nVideo\nTweaking the default values of the styles.",

Adding new style nodes and specifying their selections to limit limit the style to particular selections of atoms.\n\n\nSubframes\nBy default each frame on Blender’s timeline corresponds to the frame in the imported trajectory. You can increase the Subframes number for this trajectory, and the selected number of frames will be created in between the frames of the loaded trajectory.

If subframes are used, the frames of the trajectory will no longer directly correspond to the frames inside of Blender.

A sub-selection of the Target atoms can be used if the Subset input is used. You can expand the selection to include an entire residue if a single atom in that residue is selected, by setting Expand to True. In the example below, the Style Atoms is being applied to a selection, which is being calculated from the proximity of atoms to specific chains. As the cutoff for the selection is changed, it includes or excludes more atoms. The Whole Residue option also ensures that entire residues are shown.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nThe calculated selection\nSelection\n\n\nThe inverse of the calculated selection\nInverted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocket\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTarget Atoms\nNone\nThe atoms to measure the distance from.\n\n\nSubset\nTrue\nSubset of input atoms to use for proximity calculation\n\n\nExpand\nFalse\nInclude an entire residue if even a single atom is within the threshold\n\n\nDistance (A)\n5.0\nCutoff distance for the selection in Angstroms",

They work the same as any of the other nodes inside of Geometry Nodes, and can, if used, also process the data from 3D models like a cube or a monkey. They are designed with molecular data & use cases in mind, but they are not limited to usage with molecular data.\nAll of the nodes that are included are documented here, with descriptions, extra info about inputs and outputs, sometimes small demo videos showing the intended use cases of the nodes.\nExperimentation is highly encouraged, combining these nodes with others to see what kind of results you can get. Molecular Nodes came about through experimentation with nodes, and there is no better way to learn the systems then to keep plugging and unplugging different sockets, changing values and tinkering.\nAt any point you can view the internals of the node groups that are included with Molecular Nodes. With a node selected, you can Tab to enter a selected node, and use Ctrl + Tab to exit the node group. You can also do the same by right clicking. Feel free to tweak the internals of node groups, but beware that changing one node group will change that node group for all othe uses of it. Starting a new Blender session will ensure that the node groups are fresh and ‘factor reset’.",

The “Edge Index” selects the edge from all possible connected edges. Edges are unfortunately stored somewhat randomly. The resulting information is between the evaluating point and the point that the edge is between. Point Index returns -1 if not connected. In the video example, cones are instanced on each point where the Edge Index returns a valid connection. The Edge Vector can be used to align the instanced cone along that edge. The length of the edge can be used to scale the cone to the other point. As the “Edge Index” is changed, the selected edge changes. When “Edge Index” == 3, only the atoms with 4 connections are selected, which in this model (1BNA) are just the phosphates.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nWhether there is a valid edge corresponding to the given index\nIs Valid\n\n\nThe index for the other point involved in this edge, -1 if not connected\nPoint Index\n\n\nThe position for the other point involved in this edge, (0, 0, 0) if not connected\nPoint Position\n\n\nThe index on the edge domain for the selected edge. -1 if not connected\nEdge Index\n\n\nThe vector along the selected edge.

For molecule bonds, combinations of [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] will select all possible bond angles. In the video example, two edges are selected with their “Edge Index” values. Those atoms which aren’t valid return false and do not get instanced. The two edge vectors are used to calculate the perpendicular vector through cross product, around which the rotation for the cone is rotated. This demonstrates the ability to calculate the edge angle between the two selected edges.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nBoth of the selected edges are valid\nIs Valid\n\n\nAngle between the two selected edges in radians.

If the connection doesn’t exist, or the connection is back to the original point, -1 is returned. In the video example, a new point is selected based on the “Edge Index”. At that point, all of the connecting points are exposed as indices 0, 1, 2, 3. If that index is not a valid point or connection, or the point is the same as the original point that is being evaluated, then -1 is returned. This is one of the more complicated topology nodes, but allows indexing of the atoms that are bonded to a bonded atom. This helps with doing calculations for planar molecules.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nSocket\n\n\n\n\nIndex for the 0th point, connected to the point at the end of the selected edge.

MN enables easy import of molecular data such as .pdb & .mmCIF, along with a variety of molecular dynamics trajectories and topologies from a variety of simulation sources. Other data formats including electron microscopy (EM) .map, EM tomography files such as .map and .star, with the potential to support more data formats as well.\nSee the talk below at the 2022 Blender conference for an overview of the add-on it’s capabilities.\nMolecular Nodes provides the translation layer that allows importing of molecular data formats, while Blender provides the industry-leading animation and rendering tools to create visually stunning molecular graphics with ease.\nThe add-on runs on the Geometry Nodes procedural modelling and animation system inside of Blender, which gives the add-on speed and robustness with minimal user input required."

Importing every frame (interval = 1 ) will take long time to load, and balloon-out the save-file size of the .blend file. It’s best to work with some subset of the trajectory frames, and interpolate between them with Molecular Nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMolecular nodes is still surprisingly performant with thousands of frames loaded, but the .blend file takes a long time to save and load due to several GBs worth of data being save and loaded each time.\n\n\nFor this example we are going to import every 10th frame.\n\n\n2.2 Click ‘Import Frames’ and Wait\nMolecular Nodes is working through a lot of data, so this load step can take a few minutes - be patient. Once it’s all loaded, the structure along with the atomic properties are available for use inside of Geometry Nodes!\n\n\n2.3 Click space to play the animation.\nEnsure to change over to Cycles & rendered view to view the coloured atoms, but otherwise the animation should be playing if press space!\nJust Points\nVideo\nRendered View In this scene I additionally added a Sun light.\nVideo\n\n\n2.4 Geometry Nodes\nNow that the animation is imported into geometry nodes, you can work with the points as you would otherwise.\nTry applying some noise, or in this example, scaling the points to 0 based on the proximity to an empty.\nVideo"

If you have a powerful enough computer, you can spend the majority of your time in either Rendered or Material Preview view which will ensure everything is shaded and lighting is calculated.

    "text": "Rendering Engines\nAlready there are different ways to view the scene, through the ‘rendered view’ and the other methods. Even with the option of rendered view, there are multiple different rendering engines. Two rendering engines come pre-installed with Blender, with the possibility to use more. The two rendering engines that come pre-installed are Eevee and Cycles. By default Eevee is enabled, but you can change to Cycles in the Render Properties tab.\nEevee is much faster and more responsive than Cycles, but a lot of the time doesn’t ‘look as nice’. Eevee is a real-time rendering engine built for performance and interactivity, while Cycles is a path-traced rendering engine built for physically accurate light calculations. This is much slower to calculate but often results in ‘nicer’ lighting. Both rendering engines are excellent and are helpful in different scenarios depending on the desired outcomes.\nThe default style Atoms Cycles inside of Molecular Nodes is only visible inside of Cycles for performance reasons. All other styles are visible inside of both rendering engines. If your atoms seem to be invisible, check the rendering engine and style that you are using.\n\nIf you have the option available, ensure to switch to GPU Compute instead of CPU when using the Cycles render engine. This will usually always be the better option, and the perforamnce will be much better.\n\nVideo",

Instead, it will render whatever the Camera** is seeing. This can be frustrating at first, but it makes sense when you can have multiple cameras in a single scene.\nTo see what the camera sees, you can click the Camera widget in the top right, or click backtick (`) + 1.\n\nThe backtick is directly under the Esc key on most American / Enlgish keyboards. It can vary in other language layouts.\n\nVideo\nOnce you are happy with the camera framing, click render.\n\n\n\nThe render menu.\n\n\nA window should appear, showing the rendered image. Isn’t it magnificent?\nThe rendered image is not saved. You have to manually save the image by clicking Image -&gt; Save As and choose where to save the image.\n\n\n\nThe rendered image window.",

    "text": "Materials\nOne of the hardest things to get used to while working in 3D is the idea of materials. What if we want to make the monkey head Red? In 3D we can’t just make things red. Instead we have to assign it a material. This material can have the property that it is primarily red, but it is also metallic, has a sheen, reflects light, can be partially transparent as well as a whole range of other properties.\nComplex shading is an entire career itself, so we won’t get too much in to it. In this example we will just add a material to the monkey to make it red, and a different material to the cube to make it blue.\n\nIf you can’t see the colors changing, ensure you are in Rendered view.\n\nIn the example below, we create a new material called Material.001 for the monkey which we change to red. The cube already has a material called Material. We change the material being used to the monkey’s material, before changing it back and editing the starting material so that it is blue.\nTry playing around with some of the other material settings, to see what effects you can create.\n\n\nVideo\nAssigning materials to objects.",

    "text": "Edit Mode\nThe last thing to be aware of when working inside of a 3D program like Blender, is that you can manually edit the 3D objects that are inside of the scene. In the top left hand corner of the 3D viewport. With an object selected, you can change between the different modes. You can edit the physical shape of a mesh, by moving individual or groups of vertices, by going into Edit Mode. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Tab\n\n\n\nThe different modes are available when an object is selected.\n\n\nWith a mesh object selected, you can change in to edit mode. While in edit mode, different options are available to you, and you can phsyically edit the mesh. Try selecting some vertices of the mesh and moving them around individually.\n\n\nVideo\nExample of entering edit mode.\n\n\nYou now know the very basics of adding new objects, changing the materials, adding some lights and rendering an image. The same principles apply to everything that you you do in Blender, and often all of the different workspaces will contain similar keyboard shortcuts and ways of working. Try playing around some more inside of the 3D scene, rendering some different 3D images, before moving on to the section which includes actual proteins.\nMost things are best learnt by doing, so load some proteins in and try to follow along with the other tutorials.",

This node will take the atoms of a structure and can transfer the information from that structure onto the surface created for that volume.\nThe structure which we have currently imported however isn’t showing the atoms - it is displaying the ribbon style. We can duplicate the structure with Shift + D in the 3D viewport, and change the node group used so that it displays the atoms rather than applying a style.\nVideo\nIn the demo video, we duplicate the object. When duplicating, both objects are using the same node tree, so we then also duplicate the node tree. Now we can remove the style from the new node tree, and use this object to sample colors for our surface. The original structure object remains unchanged and still contains a node tree which applies the ribbon style.\nIf you want to change the colors which are applied to the surface, we change the node tree of the object which contains the atoms. Changing thesse nodes will change the colors that are applied, and thus change the colors which are sampled to the surface for coloring.\nVideo",
