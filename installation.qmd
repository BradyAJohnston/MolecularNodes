To install molecular nodes, download the [latest release](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/releases) from the github releases page.
Ensure that you have a version of Molecular Nodes that matches the version of Blender you have installed.

> The current Molecular Nodes release only supports Blender 3.1.2.

# Installing the Base Add-on

## Download the Latest Release

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/releases/tag/v0.5.15).

## Open a New Session of Blender

## Open Preferences Panel

> Click 'Edit' -\> 'Preferences' or press `Cmd` + `,` on Mac.

## Click 'Install' on the Addon Page

> Click on the 'Add-ons\` tab on the middle left, then the 'Install' button on the top right.

## Select `molecular_nodes_X.zip`

> The `X`'s will be the current version number of the add-on.

> Importantly do not download the entire Molecular Nodes GitHub repo and try to install that.
> Download the bundled release from the [release page](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/releases) and install that with Blender.

## Enable the Add-on

If the preferences panel doesn't automatically show the installed add-on, search for the add-on to find it.
Tick the box in the upper-left corner to enable it.![](images/CleanShot%202022-05-19%20at%2014.54.44.png)

# Installing Additional Dependencies

## Installing Atomium

To be able to download from the [wwPDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) and open local `.pdb` and `.mmcif` files, click the 'Install Atomium' button, which will install the python package [atomium](https://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium) and make it available to Blender's bundled Python.

Wait several seconds, and when Molecular Nodes detects it has successfully installed, the button should change away from red.

Molecular nodes is now ready to be used.
If you wish to enable reading of Molecular Dynamics trajectory files, such as `.xtc` from GROMACS, then you will need to install MDAnalysis.
Checkout the [Getting Started page](getting-started.qmd) on how to import structures from the PDB with molecular nodes.

## Installing MDAnalysis

To parse and work with trajectory files, we use the great python package [MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis).
Unfortunately we are unable to install this package inside of Blender's bundled python, so it requires some extra steps to enable this functionality.

### Installing MDAnalysis in Your Own Python

Blender 3.1.\* is bundled with Python 3.10.
It is best if you have a local installation of the same Python version, to avoid potential errors, but some version mismatch may be workable.

Once you have an instllation of Python 3.10, install the MDAnalysis package as below.

``` bash
python3 -m pip install MDAnalysis
```

### Getting the location of MDAnalysis

Once the package has successfully installed, find the path to the package installation by importing the package inside of python and accessing the `__path__` attribute.

*Run Python*

``` bash
python3
```

*Import MDanalysis and get the path*

``` python
import MDAnalysis as mda
mda.__path__
```

#### Example terminal output.

![](images/paste-751E10EC.png)Copy this path without the 'MDAnalysis' part, so the above path would be like this:

``` bash
/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages
```

And paste this into the path in the preferences panel of Molecular Nodes.

Now click the 'Check Installation' button to see if Molecular Nodes can load MDAnalysis successfully.

If this fails, you may need to restart Blender and press the 'Check Installation' button again.

If successful, the red button will change colour as below, and all of the functionality of Molecular Nodes should be available.

# Start Importing Structures!

Molecular nodes should be fully installed.
