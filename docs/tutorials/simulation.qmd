Inside of Geometry Nodes, we can run simulations using the **Simulation Zone**.
In the most simple form, a simulation is just doing something with data from a previous iteration of the data.
The easiest example of this is moving the positions of some points, building on top of the previous positions of the point from earlier time points. 

### Molecular Nodes

The approach taken in Molecular Nodes is include several "lower-level" nodes that can run simulations in a more generic way. Simulations are still to be considered experimental in MN, so the nodes and methods may change in the future.


### Simulate Elastic Network

This node simulates the edges of a mesh. It's intended for simulating an elastic network, but any mesh that is passed in will be simulated. By default the starting length of the edges be used as the rest length and the simulation will attempt to keep the edges at that length.

In the below examble, we create an elastic network between the alpha carbons of a protein structure, then use the node to simulate the network. This can then be styled using the **Style Ribbon** node, which only requires the alpha carbons of a structure to work.

### Simulate Curve

This is the simplest simulation nodes, which simulates any _Curve_ geometry that it is given, attempting to maintain the length between points of the curve and also handling point collisions.

The simplest inputs for this simulation are `Points::Int` which indicate how many points on the curve before and after this current point to check when trying to maintain length, and also the `Straightness::Float` which is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how straight the curve should be.

### Simulate on Faces

This node simulates points with collisions, while also ensuring they remain attached to the faces of a mesh. It's intended for simulating membranes or something similar, where points need to collide side to side, but you can input and shape mesh and it will ensure the points stay attached to it.
