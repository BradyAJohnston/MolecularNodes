An essential step during cryo-EM data processing is to determine the location and orientation of molecules in cryo-EM micrographs.
This information is often saved in starfiles, which can be important to use this information.
By instancing structures or densities using the location and orientation information a mesoscale model of the cryo-EM sample can be generated and visualized.

## Example data

This tutorial uses single particle analysis tutorial data from Relion 4.0. 
Download instruction are [here](https://relion.readthedocs.io/en/release-4.0/SPA_tutorial/Introduction.html). 
You will only need the precalculated results.
