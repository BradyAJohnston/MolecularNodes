Inside of Geometry Nodes, we can run simulations using the **Simulation Zone**.
In the most simple form, a simulation is just doing something with data from a previous iteration of the data.
The easiest example of this is moving the positions of some points, building on top of the previous positions of the point from earlier time points.
