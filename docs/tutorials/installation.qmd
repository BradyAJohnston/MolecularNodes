# Blender 4.2
For Blender 4.2, we no longer have to download anything externally. Molecular Nodes can be installed and updated from _within_ Blender, using the new [`extensions`](https://https://extensions.blender.org/) platform. The installation instructions below are now much simpler.
:::

## Downloading Blender

Molecular Nodes is an add-on for the 3D animation program Blender. It runs inside of Blender, so the first step for installation is to [download and install](https://www.blender.org/download/) the latest version of blender.

## Installing the Addon

Follow the screenshots below to install the add-on. These steps should be the same across platforms.

Open the preferences window.

Select the `Get Extensions` panel and search for `Molecular Nodes`.

Clicking the `Install` button will download and install the add-on. The download is ~100 MB so may take some minutes depending on internet connection.

### That's it! 

All of the additional python packages now come pre-installed. To update the add-on, use the same panel and Blender should automatically detect updates.

## Installing the Startup Template

There are a number of settings that are useful to have tweaked on startup. You can install the `Molecular Nodes` startup template in the add-on preferences or uninstall the template.

THis adds it as an option on the startup splash screen, or when starting a new file.

## Start Importing Structures!

Molecular nodes should be fully installed. See the [Getting Started](tutorials/01_importing.qmd) page on how to start importing into Blender!

## Troubleshooting

### Installation error: missing biotite module

In some Linux systems, trying to install `Molecular Nodes` through the `Get Extensions` panel in Blender may lead to the following error:

```bash
Report: Error
No module named 'biotite.structure.bonds' 
```
This is likely due to a mismatch in the Python versions installed in your system and in what Blender expects (see issue [#629](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/issues/629)). 

To avoid this issue, try installing Blender through a self-contained package system such as Flatpack or Snap. These package managers usually need to be installed and/or activated in your system.

For example, after installing Snap in Fedora 40, you can install Blender through Snap with the command which solves the `biotite` dependency error.

```bash
sudo snap install blender --classic
```
