Molecular Nodes (MN) is an addon for the 3D modelling & animation program [Blender](https://blender.org).
MN enables easy import of molecular data such as `.pdb` & `.mmCIF`, along with a variety of molecular dynamics trajectories and topologies from a variety of simulation sources. Other data formats including electron microscopy (EM) `.map`, EM tomography files such as `.map` and `.star`, with the potential to support more data formats as well.

See the talk below at the 2022 Blender conference for an overview of the add-on it's capabilities.

Molecular Nodes provides the translation layer that allows importing of molecular data formats, while Blender provides the industry-leading animation and rendering tools to create visually stunning molecular graphics with ease.

The add-on runs on the [Geometry Nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction.html) procedural modelling and animation system inside of Blender, which gives the add-on speed and robustness with minimal user input required.

## Getting Started

To get started, checkout the [installation page](#installation) for detailed instructions on how to install the add-on. Next check out some of the tutorials, such as [intro to blender](tutorials/00_interface.md), [basics of downloading](tutorials/01_importing.qmd) from the PDB or how to [customise selections](tutorials/02_selections.md).

There are some _outdated_ tutorials on YouTube about how to use the add-on also. MN has been developed further and improved since these videos, but the general workflow remains the same.
