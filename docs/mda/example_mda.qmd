Here is some example code that uses MDAnalysis to load a trajectory and visualize it with MolecularNodes.

```{python}
import molecularnodes as mn
import MDAnalysis as mda
can = mn.Canvas()
```

## Loading a Trajectory

```{python}
from pathlib import Path
folder =  Path("../../") / "tests/data/md_ppr"
u = mda.Universe(folder / "box.gro", folder / "first_5_frames.xtc")
traj = mn.entities.Trajectory(u)
print(traj)
```
