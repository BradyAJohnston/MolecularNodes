{
    "MN_select_separate_atoms": "Select only the desired input atoms. The output is bits of geometry, which include the selection and include the inverse of the selected atoms. You can expand the selection to include an entire residue if a single atom in that residue is selected, by setting `Whole Residue` to `True`.",

    "MN_select_proximity": "Create a selection based on the proximity to the Target Atoms of the input. A sub-selection of the Target atoms can be used if the `Selection` input is used. You can expand the selection to include an entire residue if a single atom in that residue is selected, by setting `Whole Residue` to `True`.\nIn the example below, the `MN_style_atoms` is being applied to a selection, which is being calculated from the proximity of atoms to specific chains. As the cutoff for the selection is changed, it includes or excludes mode atoms. The `Whole Residue` option also ensures that entire residues are shown.",
    "MN_select_atomic_number": "Select single elements, by matching to the `atomic_number` field. Useful for selecting single elements, or combining to select elements higher than 20 on the periodic table.",
    "MN_select_element": "Select individual elements, for the first 20 elements on the periodic table. For selections of higher elements, use [`MN_select_atomic_number`](#select-atomic-number). Creating a node which includes more elements becomes too large to be practical.",

This node is built uniquely each time, to the inputs will look different for each user.\nIn the example below, residues 10 & 15 are selected, as well as residues between and including 20-100.\nThe node was created by inputting `10, 15, 20-100` into the node creation field.",

    "MN_select_whole_res": "Expand the given selection to include a whole residue, if a single atom in that residue is selected. Useful for when a distance or proximity selection includes some of the residue and you wish to include all of the residue.",

    "MN_select_attribute": "Selections based on the different attributes that are available on the atomic geometry.",
    "MN_select_cube": "Create a selection that is inside the `Empty_Cube` object. When this node is first created, an _empty_ object called `Empty_Cube` should be created. You can always create additional empty objects through the add menu, to use a different object. The rotation and scale of the object will be taken into account for the selection.",
    "MN_select_sphere": "Create a selection that is within a spherical radius of an object, based on that object's scale. By default an _empty_ object called `Empty_Sphere` is created. You can use other objects or create a new empty to use. The origin point for the object will be used, which should be taken in to account when using molecules. Use [`MN_select_proximity`](#select-proximity) for selections which are within a certain distance of a selection of atoms instead of a single origin point.",

    "MN_color_set":"The is the primary way to change the color of structures in Molecular Nodes. Colors for cartoon and ribbon are taken from the _alpha-carbons_ of the structures. Change the color of the input atoms, based on a selection and a color field. The color field can be as complex of a calculation as you wish. In the example below the color for the whole structure can be set, or the color can be based on a color for each chain, or the result of mapping a color to an attribute such as `b_factor`.",
    "MN_color_goodsell": "Change the inputted color to be darker for non-carbon atoms. Creates a _Goodsell Style_ color scheme for individual chains.",

    "MN_color_common": "Choose a color for each of the common elements. This is a smaller convenience node for elements which commonly appear in macromolecular structures. Use [`MN_color_element`](#color-element) for the first 20 elements and [`MN_color_atomic_number`](#color-atomic-number) for individual elements with higher atomic numbers.",
    "MN_color_element": "Choose a color for each of the first 20 elements on the periodic table. For higher atomic number elements use [`MN_color_atomic_number`](#color-atomic-number).",
    "MN_color_res_name_peptide": "Choose a color for each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Non AA atoms will retain their currently set color.",

    "MN_color_atomic_number": "Choose a color for an individual element. Select the element based on `atomic_number`. Useful for higher atomic number elements which are less commonly found in structures.",

    "MN_color_chain_id_": "Choose the colors for individual chains in the structure. This node is generated for each particular molecule, so the inputs will look different based on the imported structure. For larger structures with many chains this node may become too large to be practical, in which case you might better use [`MN_color_entity_id`](#color-entity-id).",
    "MN_color_entity_id_": "Choose the colors for individual entities in the structure. Multiple chains may be classified as the same entity, if they are copies of the same chain but in different conformations or positions and rotations. The nodes is generated for each individual structure, if `entity_id` is available.",
    
    "MN_style_atoms": "Style to apply the traditional space-filling atomic representation of atoms. Spheres are scaled based on the `vdw_radii` attribute. By default the _Point Cloud_ rendering system is used, which is only visible inside of Cycles.",
