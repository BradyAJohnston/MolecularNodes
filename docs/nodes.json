    "MN_select_element": "Select individual elements, for the first 20 elemnts on the periodic table. For selections of higer elements, use [`MN_select_atomic_number`](#select-atomic-number). Creating a node which includes more elements becomes too large to be practical.",
    "MN_select_cube": "Create a selection that is inside the `Empty_Cube` object. When this node is first created, an _empty_ object called `Empty_Cube` should be created. You can always create additional empty objects through the add menu, to use a different object. The rotation and scale of the object will be taken into account for the selection.",

    "MN_style_atoms": "Style to apply the traditional space-filling atomic representation of atoms. Spheres are scaled based on the `vdw_radii` attribute. By default the _Point Cloud_ rendering system is used, which is only visible inside of Cycles.", 
    "MN_style_cartoon": "Style to apply the traditional cartoon representation of protein structures. This style highlights alpha-helices and beta-sheets with arrows and cylinders.", 
    "MN_style_ribbon": "Style that creates a continuous solid ribbon or licorice tube through the alpha-carbons of the structure.", 
    "MN_style_surface": "Style that creates a surface representation based on the proximity of atoms to a probe that is moved through the entire structure."
