# The API is Unstable

Molecular Nodes is designed and created first and foremost as an add-on for Blender, so the API can at times seem a bit quirky and for the time being is not to be considered stable.

Molecular Nodes is versioned to match Blender versions, so while we are currently up to "4.2.*", the  API should be not be consired to be that mature.
:::

This is how we can use the API.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
import bpy
bpy.ops.wm.read_homefile(app_template="")
```

```{python}
import molecularnodes as mn
import numpy as np

# we currently have to manually register a lot of the internals with Blender
mn.register()
mn.template.install()


# create a 'Molecule' object, by fetching a structure and parsing it into the scene
mol = mn.Molecule.fetch("6N2Y").add_style('ribbon')
```

## The Molecule Object

The `Molecule` object has the original data, as well as the Blender object associated with.

The different methods that are associated mostly interact with the Blender object, which is accessible via the `mol.object`, and the data is accessible via `mol.atom_array`, which is a `biotite.AtomArray` object.
```{python}
print(f"{len(mol)=}")
print(f"{mol.object=}")
print(f"{mol.atom_array[:10]=}")
```

```{python}
mol.named_attribute('chain_id')
```

```{python}
mol.position
```

### Updating the Atom Positions

```{python}
mol.position -= mol.centroid()
mol.position
```

```{python}
canvas = mn.scene.Canvas()
canvas.resolution = (720, 480)

codes = ["4ozs", "8H1B", "8U8W"]
styles = ['cartoon', 'ribbon', 'spheres']
materials = ['MN Ambient Occlusion', 'MN Default', 'MN Ambient Occlusion']

for code, style, material in zip(codes, styles, materials):
        canvas.scene_reset()
        canvas.render_engine = "CYCLES"
        canvas.samples_cycles = 32
        # canvas.cycles_device = "GPU"
        canvas.cycles_device = "CPU" # can't do GPU rendering on GitHub actions
        mol = mn.Molecule.fetch(code)
        # note: materials are not available....
        # mol.material = bpy.data.materials[material]
        mol.style = 'ribbon'
        canvas.frame_object(mol)
        mol.style = style
        canvas.snapshot()

```
