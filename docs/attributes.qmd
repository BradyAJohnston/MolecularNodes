# Attributes

Below are the attributes which are potentially created when a structure is imported

more detailed explanations of type conversions can be found in the Blender documentation [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/attributes_reference.html)

When an attribute is going to be read from the geometry, it is colored red like so: `Index::Input`, `chain_id`, etc.

## Attribute Types

Attributes are always associated with `Geometry::Geometry`. They will be stored on one of the [domains](#domains) of the geometry. The type of the attribute is determined by the type of the data it contains. The following types are supported by Geometry Nodes.

| Type              | Description                                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Int::Int`        | 32-bit integers                                       |
| `Float::Float`    | 32-bit floating point numbers                         |
| `String::String`  | Strings                                               |
| `Bool::Bool`      | Booleans                                              |
| `Vector::Vector`  | 3D vectors                                            |
| `Matrix::Matrix`  | 4x4 matrices                                          |
| `Color::Color`    | RGBA colors                                           |
| `Rotation::Rotation` | A rotation that internally is represented as a quaternion, but can implicitly be converted to an `Euler::Vector` vector. |
