Molecular Nodes and Geometry Nodes in general has a lot more advanced functionality, but this can get quite complex quite quickly. Please see the additional tutorials for how to use some of that functionality. I also recommend finding more general Geometry Nodes tutorials for Blender, as all of that knowledge will help you work with Molecular Nodes inside of Blender and producing cool protein visualisations!\nOnce you start getting the hang of it, I find the best way to learn is just to play around, plugging different nodes into different sockets to see what might happen - the result might not be what you were looking for but something that you really like!"

    "text": "Atomic Properties\nA limitation of Molecular Nodes currently is the inability to have text attributes. To get around this, Molecular Nodes translates the different properties into numerical versions, and provides nodes to interact with the numeric versions of the data.\n\nAmino Acid Names\nFor example, the different amino-acid names have been assigned values from 1-20 based on alphabetical order. The properties is available from the MOL_atomic_properties nodes under the AA_name property. The property is a green diamond, indicating that it is an integer field and compatible with other numeric field sockets.\n\nAs an example, we can generate a random colour based on the numerical representation of the amino acid name, and colour out atoms based on that.\nCreate a Random Value node by pressing Shift + A inside of the Geometry Nodes window and selecting Utilities -> Random Value, and placing the node. Change the random type from Float to Vector. Plug the output of the AA_name into the ID of the Random Value node and plug the output into the different coloured sockets for the different elements in the MOL_style_colour node, as shown below.\nWe are creating a random numerical vector, with generated from the amino acid name. While we have created a numeric vector and not a colour vector, Blender treats an XYZ vector the same as an RGB vector and vice-versa, so you can use them interchangeably.\n\nThe different atoms should now be coloured based on their amino-acid name."
